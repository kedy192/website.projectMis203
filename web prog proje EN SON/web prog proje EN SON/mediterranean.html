                <h3>Traditional Sıkma (Turkish Flatbread)</h3>

                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2–3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>About 1 cup lukewarm water (as needed)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>200 g white cheese (feta-style)</li>
                    <li>1 small bunch parsley, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>Optional: pre-cooked ground meat, lightly seasoned</li>
                    <li>2–3 tbsp butter or vegetable oil for brushing</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the flour and salt in a large bowl. Gradually add lukewarm water while mixing until a soft but non-sticky dough forms.</li>
                    <li>Knead the dough for about 5–7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover and let it rest for 15–20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, crumble the cheese into a bowl and mix it with the finely chopped parsley. If you are using cooked ground meat, mix a small amount into the filling.</li>
                    <li>Divide the rested dough into equal balls (about the size of a small orange). Keep them covered so they do not dry out.</li>
                    <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball into a thin, round flatbread using a rolling pin.</li>
                    <li>Spread a thin, even layer of the cheese–parsley mixture over one half of the rolled dough, leaving a small border at the edges.</li>
                    <li>Fold the dough over the filling to form a semicircle or long wrap, gently pressing the edges to seal so the filling does not spill out.</li>
                    <li>Heat a saj (convex griddle) or a non-stick pan over medium heat. Place one stuffed flatbread onto the hot surface.</li>
                    <li>Cook for 2–3 minutes on each side until light golden spots appear and the dough is cooked through.</li>
                    <li>As soon as you remove the flatbread from the pan, brush both sides lightly with melted butter or oil to keep it soft and add flavor.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling. Cut into pieces and serve warm with tea or fresh vegetables.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>About 1 cup water</li>
                    <li>200 g firm tofu, crumbled</li>
                    <li>1 small bunch parsley, finely chopped</li>

                </ul>

                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the dough by mixing flour and salt in a bowl. Add water gradually and knead until you get a smooth, soft dough.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for 15–20 minutes while you prepare the filling.</li>
                    <li>For the filling, place the tofu in a bowl and mash it with a fork until crumbly. Add parsley, a little salt, olive oil, and optional spices such as red pepper flakes.</li>
                    <li>Divide the dough into equal balls. Roll out each ball into a thin circle on a floured surface.</li>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of the tofu mixture over half of the dough, leaving the edges clean.</li>
                    <li>Fold the dough over the filling to close it, gently pressing the edges so the filling stays inside.</li>
                    <li>Heat a dry non-stick pan over medium heat. Place the stuffed flatbread into the pan.</li>
                    <li>Cook each side for 2–3 minutes until brown spots appear and the dough is fully cooked.</li>
                    <li>Brush lightly with olive oil after removing from the pan to keep it soft and add flavor.</li>
                    <li>Slice and serve warm as a quick vegan snack or breakfast wrap.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 cups fine bulgur for köfte</li>
                    <li>3/4–1 cup hot water (for soaking)</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp tomato + pepper paste</li>
                    <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
                    <li>1 tsp chili flakes</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>

                    <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>1 cup tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp pomegranate molasses</li>
                    <li>1 small bunch parsley, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>Plain yogurt for serving (optional)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the fine bulgur in a large bowl. Pour hot water over it just until covered, cover the bowl, and let it sit for about 10 minutes until the bulgur softens.</li>
                    <li>Once softened, add the egg, 1–2 tbsp of tomato/pepper paste, cumin, chili flakes, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Knead the mixture with your hands for 8–10 minutes until it becomes sticky and holds together. If the mixture feels too loose, add a little flour or semolina.</li>
                    <li>Take small pieces from the mixture and roll them into marble-sized balls. Press your fingertip into the center of each ball to form a small indentation.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Add the bulgur balls carefully and cook until they rise to the surface, about 5–7 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the balls are cooking, prepare the sauce. Heat olive oil in a pan, add the chopped garlic, and sauté briefly without burning.</li>
                    <li>Add the remaining tomato and pepper paste, then stir in the tomato sauce and pomegranate molasses. Simmer for a few minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.</li>
                    <li>Drain the cooked bulgur balls and gently transfer them into the pan with the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Toss everything carefully so that each ball is well coated with the garlic–tomato sauce.</li>
                    <li>Turn off the heat and mix in the chopped parsley.</li>
                    <li>Serve warm on a plate or shallow bowl, optionally with a side of plain yogurt.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For the large “mother” meatballs:</strong> 300 g ground meat, 1 cup fine bulgur, 2–3 tbsp semolina, salt, pepper</li>
                    <li><strong>For the small “daughter” meatballs:</strong> 1 cup fine bulgur, hot water, salt</li>
                    <li>1 cup boiled chickpeas</li>
                    <li>1.5–2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
                    <li>1–2 tbsp pomegranate molasses</li>
                    <li>6–7 cups water or meat stock</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp dried mint</li>
                    <li>1 tsp chili flakes (optional)</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>To make the large meatballs, place the ground meat, bulgur, semolina, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Knead the mixture for several minutes until it becomes very firm and well combined.</li>
                    <li>Shape the mixture into walnut-sized balls, pressing firmly so they do not break in the soup. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>For the small meatballs, soak the fine bulgur with hot water and a little salt. After it softens, knead until the mixture is sticky and forms easily.</li>
                    <li>Roll the bulgur mixture into tiny, chickpea-sized balls and set aside on a tray.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, whisk tomato paste into water or meat stock until dissolved. Bring to a simmer and season lightly with salt.</li>
                    <li>Add the boiled chickpeas to the pot and let the soup base simmer for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Carefully place the large “mother” meatballs into the simmering liquid. Cook gently for 10–12 minutes, trying not to stir too much so they do not fall apart.</li>
                    <li>Add the small “daughter” meatballs into the pot and continue to simmer until all of the balls are cooked through and floating, about 10 more minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the pomegranate molasses and adjust the seasoning with more salt or chili flakes if desired.</li>
                    <li>In a small pan, melt the butter and add dried mint (and chili flakes, if using). Let it sizzle for a few seconds to release the aroma, then remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Pour the hot mint butter over the soup and gently stir once.</li>
                    <li>Serve the soup hot in deep bowls, making sure each bowl has both large and small meatballs and some chickpeas.</li>
