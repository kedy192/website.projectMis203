        <p>
            This website is a student project about regional Turkish cuisine and vegan nutrition.
            Each group member is responsible for one region of Turkey and prepares both
            traditional and vegan versions of selected dishes.

         This website is prepared for the student project of MIS students. It is about vegan nutritions and Turkish cuisine, and aims to help people to learn how easy to prepare and consume vegan meals even for the popular tastes, while keeping the original taste. Besides that, these selected traditions present the idea that we can make the cultural dishes more heathier and environmentally friendly. People can reach the recipes from the buttons on the map in our homepage.
