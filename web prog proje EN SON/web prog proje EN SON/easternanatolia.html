                <h3>Traditional Erzurum Ketesi</h3>

                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dough:</strong> 4 cups flour, 1 cup lukewarm milk, 1/2 cup water (as needed), 1/3 cup oil or melted butter, 1 packet instant yeast (7 g), 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp salt</li>
                    <li><strong>Filling:</strong> 1.5 cups flour, 4–5 tbsp butter, pinch of salt (optional: crumbled white cheese)</li>
                    <li>1 egg yolk for brushing</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a bowl, mix lukewarm milk, sugar and yeast. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until slightly foamy.</li>
                    <li>Add flour, salt, oil or melted butter and enough water to make a soft dough. Knead for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for 45–60 minutes, or until doubled in size.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Melt the butter in a pan, add the flour and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the flour turns light golden and smells nutty. Add a pinch of salt and let it cool. Mix in cheese if you are using it.</li>
                    <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into equal balls (about 10–12 pieces).</li>
                    <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball into a thin circle or rectangle with a rolling pin.</li>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of the roasted flour filling over the whole surface of the dough, leaving a small border at the edges.</li>
                    <li>Fold the sides of the dough toward the center to form a square or envelope-shaped packet, trapping the filling inside. Pinch the seams to seal.</li>
                    <li>Place each pastry on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Cover and let them rest for another 15–20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Brush the tops with egg yolk. If you like, lightly score patterns on top with a fork.</li>
                    <li>Bake in a preheated 180°C (350°F) oven for 20–25 minutes, or until the ketes are puffed and deep golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Serve warm or at room temperature with tea.</li>

                    <li>If using meat, add the boiled meat pieces to the pot and simmer together for a few minutes.</li>

                    <li>Take a ladle of the hot cooking liquid from the pot and slowly add it to the yogurt mixture while whisking to temper it.</li>
